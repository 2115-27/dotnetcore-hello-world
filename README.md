# Simple .NET Core v2.0.0 Hello World Application

A very simple hello world application, just to get a feel of the basics of the C# language and how the framework runs.

## Installation

First download the .NET Core v2.0.0 installation package for Windows, Linux of macOS. After that install the dependencies and run the compilation script:

```
$ dotnet restore
$ dotnet run
```

You could also `dotnet build` and `dotnet exec ... `, but `dotnet run` is a shortcut to do both of these things.
